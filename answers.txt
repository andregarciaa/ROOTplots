Q1: What's a script and a module, what is the difference between them?
    - A script is a code capable of being executed.
    - A module is a part of code with a precise function which works by 
      itself but when being implemented inside a script in order to be 
      able to be executed.
    - Difference: the complexity: modules are functions inside scripts.

Q2: How can you break a line while you are writing a string variable larger 
than 80 char.: "somethingverylongblahblahblabh.."?
    - Ending the line with a back slash "\".

Q3: When is it executed that lines? (from "if __name__=='__main__':")
            a. when you run from bash terminal "python root_plots.py"
            b. when you run from python interpreter "import root_plots"
          Why?
    - This part is only executed when we run from the bash terminal, introducing 
      "python root_plots.py". When running from the terminal, we are executing the
      the script as principal program and its variable "__name__" (the name of the 
      program) gets called "__main__". If the code is being imported, this variable 
      takes the name of the script and these lines are never executed.

Q4: Show how to check in one line of code how to check if a file exists in 
a given path using
            a. glob module
            b. os.path module
    - With glob, after "import glob":
	 glob.glob('FileName')
      It returns an array with the name of the file if it exists.
	
    - With os.path, after doing "import os.path":
	 os.path.isfile("FileName")    
      It returns True if the file exists.


Q5: Use a str method to check whether or not the substring "myfriend" is in 
the string "dontlooseyourmind_my_friend"
    - One way of checking this is the following: 
      "myfriend" in "dontlooseyourmind_my_friend" 
    - Using a str method: 
      "dontlooseyourmind_my_friend".find("myfriend")
      if it returns -1 value, the string does not contain the substring

Q6: In one line, extract the substring 'croack' from the string 
"the_frog_is_saying_croak_but_no_one_is_listening". Trick, check the 
available functions of a python str
    - The substring is saved inside "s":
s = "the_frog_is_saying_croak_but_no_one_is_listening".partition("saying_")[2].partition("_but")[0]

Q7: You cannot use "root -l path_with_root_file" inside a python script. Why?
    - Because this is a command line, it uses terminal comands defined in $PATH.
